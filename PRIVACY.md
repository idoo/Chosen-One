At Chosen-One, your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the app. We aim to be simple, transparent, and secure.

## Information We Collect
Chosen-One is designed to deliver daily secret missions and fitness challenges. To do this:  
- **Notification Permissions:** We request permission to send notifications for daily missions.  
- **No Personal Data:** We don’t collect your name, email, location, or any personal details unless you voluntarily share them outside the app.  
- **Device Information:** Basic device information (e.g., iOS version) may be accessed to ensure smooth app functionality, but it is not tied to you personally.

## How We Use Your Information
- **Notifications:** To schedule and deliver daily secret missions and reminders.  
- **App Functionality:** Basic device information helps us maintain the app’s performance.  
- **No Sharing:** We never sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.

## Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage:** All app data, including completed missions and fitness tasks, is stored locally on your device.  
- **No Cloud Collection:** Chosen-One does not send data to external servers or store it remotely.  
- **Security Measures:** We implement reasonable safeguards, but no system is 100% secure. Any changes to data handling will be reflected in this policy.

## Third Parties
Chosen-One does not share your data with third parties. If we integrate features like analytics or cloud backups in the future, we will update this policy and notify users.

## Your Choices
- **Notifications:** You can disable notifications anytime in your device settings.  
- **Uninstall:** Deleting the app removes all app settings and permissions from your device.

## Children’s Privacy
Chosen-One is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. Parents who notice otherwise should contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Policy
This policy may be updated if the app changes or new features are added. We encourage users to check this page periodically for updates.
